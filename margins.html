    <p class="margintestcase">I'm happy that you're my teacher;
        I enjoy each lesson you teach.
        As my role model you inspire me
        To dream and to work and to reach.
        
        With your kindness you get my attention;
        Every day you are planting a seed
        Of curiosity and motivation
        To know and to grow and succeed.
        
        You help me fulfill my potential;
        I'm thankful for all that you've done.
        I admire you each day, and I just want to say,
        As a teacher, you're number one!

        This short Teacher Day poem is full of admiration. It's a rhyming poem.
        
        The Teacher Gets A+
        
        I look forward to your class
        When I come to school.
        You're an awesome teacher;
        I think you're very cool.
        
        You're smart and fair and friendly;
        You're helping all of us.
        And if I got to grade you,
        From me you'd get A+!
        </p>
